* Remote Command Framework Criteria
  1) Easily extensible
     - Each cmd associated with a sh script
       - exit status
       - std out
     - A directory to put cmd scripts
       - only run commands from this directory
     - Pass arguments to command.
     - Each command should have help output
  2) Testable modular components
     - No dependencies between modules
     - Framework doesn't know specific module implemention
     - Each module has a common interface.
       - Common arguments (-h for help)
       - Standard return status values
     - Modules might have module-specific pass through arguments.
  3) Somewhat secure
     - Don't allow arbitrary command execution
     - Naming convention (e.g. cmdXxxx)
  4) Bi-directional communication (limit 247 bytes in a packet)
     - proc library (libproc)
     - error handling
     - Return results
  5) Remote Command Processor (on satellite)
  6) Ground Command execution (on Ground)
