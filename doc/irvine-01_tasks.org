      - Notes
        - Beacon contents are limited to 227 bytes.
        - Use packed binary structure in network order.
        - The structure takes the form of:
      #+BEGIN_SRC c-mode
        struct {
          uint16_t id; 
          uint8_t gyro[3];
          (fill in the data)...
        } __attribute__((packed));
      #+END_SRC
        - Use network order (convert any multi-byte value using the htonl function)
        - Reduce the resolution (round them down) to save on bytes
       - If values are not valid, then they should be set to 0 (or a known invalid value)
